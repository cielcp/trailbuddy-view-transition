# Astro View Transition Demo

[**Demo Link**](https://trailbuddy-astro-view-transition-demo.netlify.app/)

This is a demo project that showcases view transitions inside of an Astro project using [Astro's opt-in client-side routing](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/) made specifically for the new [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API).

To read more about the process behind setting up this project, check out our article [`COMING SOON!`] which goes into greater detail on the design and development collaboration that went into building this demo.

## ðŸ”¥ Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have `Node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine. Once you have those installed, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4321` to view the demo.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

This project leverages [Astro's Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorials/add-content-collections/) to handle the various blog like pages. As such, the project structure contains the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ [slug].astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` and `src/content/` directories. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, are placed in the `assets/` directory while background images, videos, and fonts are placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
