description: 'Grand Canyon National Park in northwestern Arizona is an iconic destination at the top of many travelers’ bucket lists. The highlight of the park, of course, is a gorge carved by the Colorado River. The Grand Canyon is the largest canyon in the United States, measuring up to 18 miles wide, 277 miles long, and 6,000 feet deep! The Colorado River has been carving the canyon for more than 5 million years. The process has revealed rock layers that are much older — the youngest rock layer, the Kaibab Formation, is 270 million years old.'
